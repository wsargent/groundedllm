# DeepResearch

I asked Gemini 2.5 Pro to give a summary of [https://jina.ai/news/a-practical-guide-to-implementing-deepsearch-deepresearch](https://jina.ai/news/a-practical-guide-to-implementing-deepsearch-deepresearch) and it did a good job, so I'm posting it here.

## Response

Here’s what I gathered and how I see it connecting to your interests:

1.  **DeepSearch Defined:** It’s an iterative process where an AI agent continuously **searches** the web, **reads** relevant pages, and **reasons** about the information. This loop continues until it finds an optimal answer or exhausts its resources. It's a step beyond simpler RAG, involving multiple cycles and more complex decision-making by the LLM about what to do next (e.g., breaking down questions into "gap questions," rewriting queries, deciding which URLs to read).

2.  **DeepResearch Defined:** This builds on DeepSearch. It uses the DeepSearch process as a core component to generate **structured, long-form research reports**. It often involves creating an outline and then using DeepSearch to gather information for each section, followed by a coherence pass.

3.  **Relevance to Your Search Agent:** This paradigm seems to align perfectly with what you've described for your search agent that queries multiple engines and aims to determine overall relevance. The DeepSearch approach explicitly tackles:
    *   **Breaking down complex queries:** The concept of "gap questions" is a structured way to handle this.
    *   **Iterative Refinement:** Instead of a single pass, it continuously refines its understanding and search strategy.
    *   **Intelligent Source Selection:** The article mentions ranking URLs to visit next using signals like frequency, path structure, and semantic relevance (even mentioning Jina Reranker for this).
    *   **Quality over Latency:** The article notes a shift towards users accepting longer wait times for significantly more accurate and comprehensive answers, which seems to be the goal of such a system.

4.  **Key Techniques Mentioned:** The article highlights several techniques you've asked about or might find interesting:
    *   **Query Rewriting/Expansion:** Described as crucial for quality.
    *   **Agent-like Behavior:** The LLM acts as an agent, deciding on actions (search, read, reflect, answer).
    *   **Memory Management:** Storing previous attempts, visited sites, and acquired knowledge to inform future steps.

This "DeepSearch" and "DeepResearch" framework appears to be the advanced, multi-step reasoning and information synthesis capability you're aiming for with your agent, moving beyond simple search result aggregation into a more intelligent, iterative research process.

Does this align with what you mean when you refer to "DeepSearch" or the capabilities you're exploring for your project? It seems like a very powerful approach for tackling complex information needs!
